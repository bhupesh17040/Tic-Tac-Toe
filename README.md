# Tic-Tac-Toe Implementation

The repository contains a Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation made in Python.

Tic-Tac-Toe game state is defined as follows: 


tile1 |  tile2  | tile3

tile4 |  tile5  | tile6

tile7 |  tile8  | tile9



A player can belong to one of the following two categories:
1. Naive: Player checks a tile randomly.
2. Intelligent: Player follows some strategy to win a game. You shall define a strategy that an intelligent player can take.
We will estimate probability of winning for a player for different scenarios.
 
Game1: A number of games are played between two naive players. Estimate probability of winning for player1. Assume player1 starts the game.

Game2: A number of games are played between a naive and intelligent player. Estimate probability of winning for player1. Assume player1 is 
naive and starts the game.

Game3: A number of games are played between two intelligent players. Estimate probability of winning for player1. Assume player1 starts the game.
